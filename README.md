# Configuration Management System

## Overview
The **Configuration Management System** is a web application designed to manage and generate configurations for backend, server, and frontend components. It provides a robust set of endpoints, routes, and services to handle configuration data, including global and default sections, as well as dynamic generation of frontend and backend configurations. The system also includes models for backend, server, and frontend entities, along with a user-friendly interface to list and manage configurations.

This project aims to streamline configuration management by offering a centralized solution for creating, editing, deleting, and validating configurations, with support for both RESTful API endpoints and a web interface.

## Features
- **Configuration Management**:
  - Generate and manage configurations with global and default sections.
  - Create, display, and validate configurations via dedicated endpoints.
  - Dynamically generate frontend and backend configurations using a config generator service.
  - Store and manage configuration data with a dedicated storage service.
- **Backend Management**:
  - Create, edit, and delete backend entities.
  - Add and manage servers within a backend, including status checks.
  - RESTful endpoints for backend operations (e.g., `/backend/add`, `/backend/<name>/edit`, `/backend/<name>/delete`).
- **Server Management**:
  - Add, edit, delete, and check the status of servers within a backend.
  - Endpoints for server operations (e.g., `/backend/<backend_name>/server/add`, `/backend/<backend_name>/server/<server_name>/status`).
- **Frontend Management**:
  - Create, edit, and delete frontend configurations.
  - Form-based interface for adding and editing frontend entities.
  - Endpoints for frontend operations (e.g., `/frontend/add`, `/frontend/<name>/edit`, `/frontend/<name>/delete`).
- **Routing and Endpoints**:
  - Comprehensive routing for backend, server, frontend, and configuration management.
  - Endpoints for configuration display and validation (e.g., `/config`, `/config/validate`, `/config/back`).
- **Web Interface**:
  - A page to list all backend, server, and frontend configurations.
  - A page to display the current configuration.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Silakiniaina/configuration-management-system.git
   cd configuration-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you may need to install dependencies like Flask (or the framework used in `app.py`) manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application using the main entry point (`app.py`):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

## Usage
1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to access the root endpoint.
   - Visit `/config` to view the current configuration.
   - Use `/backend`, `/frontend`, and related endpoints to manage entities.

2. **Interact via API**:
   - Use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API endpoints:
     - **List Configurations**: `GET /config`
     - **Validate Configuration**: `POST /config/validate`
     - **Add a Backend**: `POST /backend/add`
     - **Add a Frontend**: `POST /frontend/add`
     - **Check Server Status**: `GET /backend/<backend_name>/server/<server_name>/status`

3. **Manage Configurations**:
   - Use the configuration generator to create frontend and backend configs dynamically.
   - Access the listing page to view all backend, server, and frontend configurations.

### Notes on the README
- The repository URL in the "Installation" section is a placeholder (`https://github.com/Silakiniaina/configuration-management-system.git`). You may need to replace it with the actual repository URL.
- The README assumes the project uses Python and a framework like Flask (inferred from `app.py` in the commits). If a different tech stack is used, the installation and usage sections may need adjustments.
- The "Contributing" section follows standard GitHub contribution practices, aligning with the merge commits seen in the history (e.g., pull requests from `feature` branches).
